# Fied Profitability Index Predictive Model
#### *By using Python and Various Machine Learning Toolbox Such as XGboost*


Background
------------
In this work, we are aiming to solve a problem in oil and gas industry mainly in the government domain/ regulator poin of view. The complexity in oil and gas business spread accross almost of its domain, one example is in development aspect when engineers have to deliver investment grade plan under high scale of investment and high uncertainty. By using subsurface-economic data from various field in Indonesia, we are able to demonstrate how wide range of data that government collected can be utilize to assisst decision maker, engineers, new venture company, etc to verify its plan before decision is made.


Objective
------------
In this work, we used a dataset from Indonesia Oil and Gas Government Institution, consisting of subsurface features such as field name, OGIP/ OOIP, and other subsurface parameters including economic indicator for each field.

Our main goal is to provide a benchmarking tool for Oil and Gas participants to get an ealy indicative economic value such as Profitability Index (PI) of newly discovered oil and gas fields. This information is crucial to enhance the field development concept from technical and economic point of view because engineer/ development staff/ entity could focus more on the fields that have higher chance to become profitable so they are able to increase their productivity and accelerate development stage.


Process Overview
----------------
In this work, we try to define wheter an oil and gas field is profitable to be further developed or not together with its probability. we also used several models such as Decision Tree, XGBoost, LGBM, and Deep Learning. The flow chart below ilustrates the process we are doing in this project.
